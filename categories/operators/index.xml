      <description>Move assignment.
Requires: that value_type and error_type both implement move assignment.
Complexity: If the value_type for both is present, uses value_type&amp;rsquo;s move assignment operator, else either destructs or move constructs value_type as appropriate. error_type&amp;rsquo;s move assignment operator is always used. Constexpr, triviality and noexcept of underlying operations is propagated.
Guarantees: If an exception is thrown during the operation, the state of both operands on entry is restored, if at least one of the underlying operations is marked noexcept.</description>
